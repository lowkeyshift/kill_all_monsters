# About
This game was built to learn more about python3. I have built this game for those to have some fun with some text based killing of Trolls, Goblins and Dragons. You as the player get to choose from three weapons the Sword, Axe, or Bow. Each with its different strengths and weaknesses. I hope you enjoy this simple, but fast paced hack and slash.
